1.The phrase " so far " is used in English to indicate the time up to the present moment or up to a certain point. 
How do you like California so far

2.When talking about preferences or feelings towards something, the phrase " I like it " is often used. Tom uses this phrase to express his positive feelings towards California.
I like it. It's different from Texas, but I like it here.

3.We often compare things using different from. It helps to describe how one thing is not the same as another.
-Instead of saying California is different from Texas, Tom says: It's different from Texas. Tom uses It's as a contraction of It and is. In this context, It refers to California.
When talking about places or things, especially when comparing or describing them, it's serves as a subject and verb starter for the sentence.

4.The phrase " let me show you " is an offer of assistance or guidance. It expresses the speaker's intention to demonstrate or direct something to the listener.
ex: This is the main office area. Let me show you to the conference room.

5.Using the correct articles (a, an, the) is crucial in English. Here, Tom is introducing himself and specifying his role at the new place.
I'm the new graphic designer.

6.Identify how articles change the context of a sentence. Articles, like the and a, can change the meaning of a sentence. The talks about something specific. A talks about something in general.

For Example: Tom is a graphic designer in our company means there are many graphic designers and Tom is one of them. Tom is the graphic designer of our company means there is only one person in the company matching this description (that's Tom).

Notice that, after graphic designer, there are details that made the situation more specific. In this company, there's only one person that could fit the profile - Tom.

7.here refers to the location of the speaker, pointing out the current place or situation they are in.
I'm from " here " in California. Welcome aboard.

8.When you want to talk about all the people in a particular group without exceptions, you use the word " everybody ". When combined with is, it means all the people in the group possess a particular characteristic. Here, Tom is saying all the people he met at the office are nice.
Thanks. 
Everybody
is so nice around here.

9.Demonstrative pronouns like " this " and " those " help to point to specific items, distinguishing them from others. Tom uses one to inquire about a particular type of desk he observes.
Hey, is 
this
 one of 
those
standing desks?

10.The demonstrative pronoun " those " refers to plural nouns that are further away from the speaker in terms of distance or not currently being handled or discussed.
This and those are both demonstrative pronouns, but they are used in different contexts. This refers to a singular item close to the speaker, while those refers to plural items that are further away or not currently being discussed.

this - is singular 
those - plural ex: those are
"""""""""""""""""This is my phone and those are my keys""""""""

11.That's so true

12.Use """this""" for something close and """that""" for something a bit far.
this
 printer right here is fast. Can you fix 
that
 computer over there?

 13.The word """inactive""" is used to describe a state of not being active or engaged in physical movement. It can refer to a lack of physical activity or any kind of action.

 14.An """"alternative""" refers to another option or solution that is different from the one currently in use or being considered.
 A different option or choice

 15.When someone says """too""" at the end of a sentence, they mean """also""" or """as well""". For example, I like it too means I also like it. Adding too at the end of a statement implies agreement or adds emphasis that a similar condition or fact applies to what's being discussed.

 16.The pronoun ""they"" is often used to refer to a group of people or entities. In this context, they refers to the people responsible within the company. """Are""" is the verb """"to be""" conjugated to agree with the plural pronoun they.
 Yeah, at this company, 
they
 
are
 very attentive to these details.

When referring to a group of people or things, we often use " they " as the subject. Usually after a subject there's a verb. When they is followed by the verb " to be " in the present simple, it is conjugated as ""are"". Example: They are my colleagues.

17.n English, the pronoun ""they"" is used for multiple people or things. When talking about the present, """they""" is often paired with ""are"".
EX:
They
 
are
 very friendly clients. I love those templates! 
those
 
are
 just my style.

18.""They're"", ""their"", and ""there"" sound similar but have different meanings. ""They're"" is a contraction of they are, ""their"" is a possessive pronoun of they, and ""there"" refers to a place or introduces a sentence or clause.

19.Being "" attentive "" means paying careful attention or listening carefully.
Listening carefully

20.The phrase "" you are into "" is an informal way to say that someone really likes something or is interested in a particular activity or topic.
To be interested in or really like

21.When you want to say that you have a strong interest in something, you can use the phrase "" I am into it "". This phrase shows what someone likes or enjoys.
I really like playing the guitar. I 
am 
into
 it.

 22.The demonstrative pronoun "" these "" points to specific items or details that are close in context or proximity. It is used to emphasize or clarify something that is currently being discussed.
 Yeah, at this company, they're very attentive to 
these
 details.

The demonstrative pronoun these is used to refer to specific items or details that are close in proximity or context. It's plural and indicates multiple items that are nearby or currently being discussed.

23.Demonstrative pronouns "" this "","" these "", and "" those "" are used to point out specific things. This refers to a singular item nearby, these to multiple items nearby, and those to items further away.

24.The articles " a " and " an " are both used to indicate a singular, non-specific noun. The choice between them depends on the sound that follows. If the next word begins with a consonant sound, we use a. If it starts with a vowel sound, we use an. For example:

Quincy is a teacher at freeCodeCamp.

The word following the article is teacher. As it starts with the sound of a consonant, the article a is the appropriate choice.

Jake is an information security analyst.

The word following the article is information. As it starts with the sound of a vowel, the article an is the appropriate choice.

25.In English, " a " and " an " are indefinite articles. " A " is used before words that begin with a consonant sound, and an is used before words that begin with a vowel sound.

26.In English, we use names to directly refer to specific people. See this example:
Hello! You're Amy, correct?
Think of names as unique labels for people. So, you don't need a, an, or the before a person's name. Just use the name by itself!

27."" Everything "" is a way to mention all the things in a particular group. When Tom says everything is perfect, he means all aspects of his new workplace are perfect.

28.The word """ someone """ is used to refer to an unspecified individual or person without specifying exactly who.
Any person, not specified.

28.The pronoun "" it "" is often used in English to talk about the weather, the time, dates, and distances. In this context, "" it "" refers to a specific time of the day, lunch time.
Is 
it
 lunch time?

29.If a person asks you a direct question using "" is it "" . For example: "" Is it true? "" You can reply to this question with these short answers:
"" Yes, it is "". For affirmative."" No, it is not ""  or ""  No, it isn't "". For negative.

30.To ask about someone's actions or plans in the present with the verb to be, you can use the structure are you at the beginning of the question. This combination of verb (are) and subject (you) helps form questions in the present simple tense.
EX:
Are you eating here? are you going out?

31.The word """ here """ is an adverb that indicates a location or place. It refers to the current location of the speaker or the location they are talking about.

32."" Going out "" refers to leaving a particular place, such as an office, to do an activity in another place, like eating. The opposite is "" eating here "", which means stay and eat at the office.

, I'm going out.

33.""" Can """ is a modal verb used to express abilities or possibilities. It indicates what someone is capable of doing.
An ability to show some places to Tom.
EX;

 43.The phrase """ go together """ is often used to suggest that two or more people accompany each other to a particular place or participate in an activity together.

 44.two or more people

go 
together

45.The expression "" look who's here "" is often used when you notice someone arriving or entering a place, especially when it's unexpected or a pleasant surprise.

46.When you want to present one person to another, you can use the phrase let me introduce you to [name] (name being the person's name). For example: Let me introduce you to Daniel.
Let me 
introduce
 you to Tom.

47.The phrase this is [name] is used to present someone in a conversation. name refers to a person's name. It's a simple and direct way to make introductions. For example: Daniel, this is Carol.

48.In English, he is a pronoun used to refer to a male person. Pronouns are useful to avoid repetition and make sentences clearer.

Notice this part of the dialogue:

Tom, this is Brian. He's a web developer. Brian, this is Tom. He's our new graphic designer and he is from Texas.

In the dialogue, after introducing Brian, Sophie uses he to talk about Brian's job. Later, she uses he again to talk about Tom and his job.

By using he, Sophie doesn't have to repeat the names Brian and Tom. This is the power of the pronouns.

49.Brian, this is Tom. He's 
our
 new graphic designer and he is from Texas.

50.The general rule for making something possessive in English is to add an apostrophe and the letter s ('s) to the end. For example, if a desk belongs to Sophie, you say Sophie's desk.
John's computer

60.To show possession in English, you typically add 's to a name, like Sophie's desk. However, for names ending in s, you often just add an apostrophe '. For example: James' book. It means the book belongs to James.

61.Sophie is a great 
workmate
. She is very kind and helpful.

62.oh! come on brain

63.Just like when you learned about the pronoun he, pronouns like she are used to refer to female individuals. They help avoid repetition in conversation. Look at this part of the dialogue:

Sophie: Oh, come on, Brian!

Brian: But it is true. She's the person to go to if you need help!

Here, She is used by Brian to refer to Sophie. Instead of repeating Sophie's name, Brian uses the pronoun she to make the conversation smoother and avoid redundancy.

64.But it is true. 
She's
 the person to go to if you need help!

65.Hi, everyone. My name is Alice and I'm happy to be part of the team.
